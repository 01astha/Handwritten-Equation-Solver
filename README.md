# Handwritten-Equation-Solver

An Handwritten Equation solver using Convolutional Nueral Network.

A Convolutional Neural Network, sometimes referred to as a ConvNet, is the most well-known image recognition and classification algorithm. CNNs were one of the key innovations that led to the deep neural network renaissance in computer vision, which is a subset of machine learning.  

Equation can contain any digit from 0-9 and symbol +,x,- works on image with white background and digits/symbols are in black.

You can run all the three .ipynb files either separately or sequentially.

1. For running Data_extraction.ipynb first download train images.rar zip file and extract it in the folder containing Data_extaction.ipynb file.
2. For running train.ipynb, you either need to download train_final.csv or you can run it after succesfully running Data_extraction.ipynb.
3. For running CNN test.ipynb, you either need to download model_final.h5 and model_final.json file or you can run it after succesfully running train.ipynb file. You also need to replace the path of the image in code from the local path of image to be tested on your computer.
